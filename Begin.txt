First things first. You'll need to config your git bash with your github username and email. If you haven't already, make a user in github. Then
use- 
 git config --global user.name "examplename"
examplename
 git config --global user.email "UserEmail@example.com"
UserEmail@example.com

For your first task you need to make your own branch under the master. Here you will store all files you need to complete the trial.
use git branch "UserName-master" to make your branch and then use the scp to get this file to your branch.

Commands - git checkout, cd, scp, ls, cat
